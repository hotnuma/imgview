## ImgView

This is a fork of Viewnior Gtk3 :  
https://github.com/Artturin/Viewnior  

From the original project by Siyan Panayotov :  
https://github.com/hellosiyan/Viewnior  

Most of the Viewnior's sources handling image viewing are adopted from the GtkImageView library by Bj√∂rn Lindqvist. The files were cleaned up and modified, so that unused functionalities were removed (GtkImageToolSelector, GtkImageToolPainter, GtkZooms). Prefixes were changed from gtk_ to uni_ for clarity.
